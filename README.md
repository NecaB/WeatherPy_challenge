# WeatherPy_challenge

This challenged required utilizing weather description data already collected and analyzed from cities across the world. This data will be used to offer recommendations for ideal hotels based on the weather preferences of clients for a PlanMyTrip app from a travel technology company.

A pandas Data Frame was used with over 500 unique cities and their real time weather data which allows us to collect and gather random latitudes and longitudes, retrieve the nearest city and perform an API call with Open Weather Map. This process assisted in visualizing and analyzing the data. The Vacation Itinerary facilitates beta testing through usage of input statements to filter the weather preferences data. This information was then used to create travel itinerary and route for travel between four cities.

Objectives 

-	Gather and analyze data about the weather across varied cities worldwide.
-	Utilized the data to provide recommendations for clientsâ€™ weather preferences on PlanMyTrip app.
-	Create a DataFrame with over 500 of these unique cities and their weather data in real time.

To perform the above stated objectives, we will 
-	Collect the data using NumPy module to generate over 1,500 random latitudes and longitudes
-	Conduct an exploratory analysis and visualization to compare the weather data.
-	Visualize the travel data by creating a map image with pop-up markers that will display information about the cities referenced from the customers criteria

Finally, the WeatherPy and API calls along with the usage of Pandas will allow customers to customize their travel experience based on weather preferences.  The app also provides hotels and cities for the preferential criteria. Additionally, the app gives an option to build a route with multiple stops.
